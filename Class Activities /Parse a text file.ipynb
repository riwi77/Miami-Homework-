    "# E-Commerce Traffic\n",
    "​\n",
    "In this activity, you will parse a text file. You will also sum the total number of customers and count of days in the text file to calculate the daily average \n",
    "of customer traffic for your e-commerce business. Assume each line is equal to a day's worth of customers.\n",
    "​\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "​\n",
    "Using the [starter file](Unsolved/ecommerce_traffic.py), complete the following steps.\n",
    "​\n",
    "1. Import the pathlib library.\n",
    "​\n",
    "2. Set the file path for the `customer_traffic.txt` data file.\n",
    "​\n",
    "3. Initialize the `customer_total` and `day_count` variables that will hold the total and count of the numbers in the text file, respectively.\n",
    "​\n",
    "4. Use the file path pointing to the `customer_traffic.txt` data file to open the file as an object.\n",
    "​\n",
    "5. Iterate over each line in the file and cumulatively add to the `customer_total` and `day_count` variables. You will need to convert the number from the text file as an int to perform numerical calculations.\n",
    "​\n",
    "6. Write the contents of the `customer_total`, `day_count`, and `daily_average` to an `output.txt` file. Your `output.txt` file should look similar to the following code block:\n",
    "​\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The total and count of the numbers in the text file are 4945 and 100, respectively. The average is 49.45.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "​\n",
    "## Hint\n",
    "​\n",
    "You already know a lot of the concepts needed to complete this activity, like variables, for loops, and formatted strings. Just take it step by step; don't let file paths and reading and writing to/from a file throw you off!\n",
