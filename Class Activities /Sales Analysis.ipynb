    "# Sales Analysis\n",
    "​\n",
    "In this activity, you will read in the `sales.csv` file to calculate customer revenue averages.\n",
    "​\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "​\n",
    "Using the [starter file](Unsolved/Core/sales_analysis_core.py), complete the following steps.\n",
    "​\n",
    "1. Import the pathlib and CSV libraries.\n",
    "​\n",
    "2. Set the `sales.csv` path.\n",
    "​\n",
    "3. Initialize a `records` list.\n",
    "​\n",
    "4. Read and iterate over the `sales.csv` file using `csv.reader()`.\n",
    "​\n",
    "5. Append a new column, average, to the header, and then add the header to the list of records.\n",
    "​\n",
    "6. Set the `name`, `count`, and `revenue` variables and convert strings to ints for numerical calculations.\n",
    "​\n",
    "7. Calculate the simple average (`revenue` over `count`), append the average to the row, and append the row to the list of records.\n",
    "​\n",
    "8. Write the list of records contained in `records` to an output CSV file.\n",
    "​\n",
    "9. Loop over every record in `records`, and use the `writerow()` function to write to an output CSV file.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Your output should look similar to the following:\n",
    "​\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  Name,Count,Revenue,Average\n",
    "  Andrew,9,58,6.44\n",

    "​\n",
    "Calculate the aggregate average for each unique customer name and output to a CSV file by completing the following steps:\n",
    "​\n",
    "1. Initialize an `analysis` dictionary.\n",
    "​\n",
    "2. Read and iterate over the `sales.csv` file using `csv.reader()`. Use an if-else statement to check the following:\n",
    "​\n",
    "    * If the customer name is not already in the `analysis` dictionary, initialize the nested key-value pairs `count` and `revenue`.\n",
    "​\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      analysis[name] = {\n",
    "          \"count\": count,\n",
    "          \"revenue\": revenue\n",
    "      }\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "​\n",
    "    * Else the customer name is already in the `analysis` dictionary, cumulatively add the `count` and `revenue` nested key-value pairs.\n",
    "​\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      analysis[name]['count'] += count\n",
    "          analysis[name]['revenue'] += revenue\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "​\n",
    "3. Set the output file path for `aggregate.csv`.\n",
    "​\n",
    "4. Write the contents of the `analysis` dictionary to `output.csv` using `csv.writer()`. Be sure to add a header to the CSV file.\n",
    "​\n",
    "Your output should look similar to the following:\n",
    "​\n",
    "```\n",
    "Name,Count,Revenue,Average\n",
    "Andrew,15,598,39.87\n",
